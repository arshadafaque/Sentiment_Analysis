**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative using various machine learning models. Sentiment analysis can help understand public opinion about movies and assist businesses in making data-driven decisions.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. It includes:

25,000 reviews for training the model.
25,000 reviews for testing and evaluating model performance.
The dataset can be found here  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews


**Models and Techniques**

The project explores multiple machine learning models for sentiment analysis, including:

-Logistic Regression
-Naive Bayes
-Random Forest
-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-AdaBoostClassifier
-GradientBoostingClassifier
-XGBClassifier

The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
